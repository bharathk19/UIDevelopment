        <h1> This is Main Heading </h1>
        <p>This Page speaks about the link of elements in one page it self i.e going from top to bottom </p>
        <h1 id="top"> Film-Making Terms </h1>
        <a href="#arc_shot"> Arc Shot </a> <br/>
        <a href="#interlude"> Interlude </a> <br/>
        <a href="#prologue"> Prologue</a> <br/>
        <p> At the top of a long page
            you might want to add a list
            of contents that links to the corresponding sections lower down. Or you might want to add a link 
            from part way down the page back to the top of it to save users from having to scroll back to the top.</p>
        <p> Before you can link to a specific part of a page, you need to identify the points in the page that the link 
            will go to. You do this using the id attribute (which can be used on every HTML element). You can see 
            that the h1 tag and h2 tag  elements in this example have been given id attributes that identify those sections 
            of the page.</p>
        <h2 id="arc_shot"> Arc shot </h2>
        <p>A shot in which the subject is photographed by an
            encircling or moving camera</p>
        <p> The value of the id attribute should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character) 
            and, on a single page, no two id attributes should have the same value.</p>
        <p> It’s hard to understand web design when you don’t understand the web. And it’s hard to understand the web when 
            those who are paid to explain it either don’t get it themselves, or are obliged for commercial reasons to suppress 
            some of what they know, emphasizing the Barnumesque over the brilliant.</p>
        <p> It’s not that Zuckerberg’s not news; and it’s not that business isn’t some journalists’ beat. But focusing on 
            business to the exclusion of all else is like reporting on real estate deals while ignoring architecture.</p>
        <h2 id="interlude"> Interlude </h2>
        <p> A brief, intervening film scene or sequence, not specifically tied to the plot, that appears
         within a film </p>
         <p> And one tires of the news narrative’s one-dimensionalism. In 1994, the web was weird and wild, they told us. In 
             ’99 it was a kingmaker; in ’01, a bust. In ’02, news folk discovered blogs; in ’04, perspiring guest bloggers on 
             CNN explained how citizen journalists were reinventing news and democracy and would determine who won that year’s 
             presidential election. I forget how that one turned out.</p>
        <p> When absurd predictions die ridiculous deaths, nobody resigns from the newsroom, they just throw a new line into 
            the water—like marketers replacing a slogan that tanked. After decades of news commoditization, what’s amazing is 
            how many good reporters there still are, and how hard many try to lay accurate information before the public. Sometimes 
            you can almost hear it beneath the roar of the grotesque and the exceptional.</p>
        <h2 id="prologue"> Prologue </h2>
        <p> A speech, preface, introduction, or brief scene preceding the the main action or plot of a film;
         contrast to epilogue</p>
         <p> News media are not the only ones getting it wrong. Professional associations get it wrong every day, and commemorate 
             their wrongness with an annual festival. Each year, advertising and design magazines and professional organizations hold 
             contests for “new media design” judged by the winners of last year’s competitions. That they call it “new media design” 
             tells them nothing and you and me everything. </p>
        <p> Although there are exceptions, for the most part the creators of winning entries see the web as a vehicle for advertising 
            and marketing campaigns in which the user passively experiences Flash and video content. For the active user, there is 
            gaming—but what you and I think of as active web use is limited to clicking a “Digg this page” button. </p>
        <p> The winning sites look fabulous as screen shots in glossy design annuals. When the winners become judges, they reward work 
            like their own. Thus sites that behave like TV and look good between covers continue to be created, and a generation of 
            clients and art directors thinks that stuff is the cream of web design. </p>
