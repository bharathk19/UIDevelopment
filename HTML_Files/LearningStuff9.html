        <!-- In above definition table tag is used to create a table in html page, then followed with an tr tag which indicates
        each row in the table. In each row we define an table data which is defined by td tag. we can also use th tag for 
        showing up the table heading, when creating an table with one empty cell then still an td or th tag should be defined 
        it represent an cell is present with no data. In th tag using scope attibute we can define whether the heading is for
        column or a row. -->
