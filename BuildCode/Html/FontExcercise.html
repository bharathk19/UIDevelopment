        The briard which is belived to have orginated in France, has been bred for centuries to herf and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French 
        Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briads were used in the First World War almost 
        to the point of extinction.
